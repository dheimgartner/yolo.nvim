# TODO

## PROCEED HERE ##

- [x] adjust yolo to conform with regular plugin (installable with lazy.nvim)
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] document (see telescope.nvim) to generate help pages within neovim
    - I think these tags (e.g., `--@param`) are `LuaDoc` and the rest is regular documentation markup (you woudl normally put directly into `doc/foo.txt`) which then is somehow extracted to autogen the docs...
